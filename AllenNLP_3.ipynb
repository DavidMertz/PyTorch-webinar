For example, perhaps we speeculate that a gated recurrent unit (GRU) will work better for the recurrent layer than a multi-layer long short-term memory (LSTM).  Moreover, we also want to try using RMSprop rather than Adam for the optimizer.  Plus we decrease the `patience` to cause a faster step-down in the learning rate.\n",
