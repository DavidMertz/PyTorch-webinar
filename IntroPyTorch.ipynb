    "At a first pass, PyTorch tensors are very similar to NumPy arrays.  Both are ways of storing multi-dimensional data efficiently, and much of the same \"vectorized\" style of operation applies to both. Broadcasting and elementwise operations are similar.  Moreover, many of the same functions and methods exist in both PyTorch and NumPy, and conversion between the two formats is made straightforward by PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where PyTorch tensors go beyond NumPy arrays, and are needed for neural networks are in a couple key areas.  As a not-so-minor matter, tensors can work transparently on GPUs as well as CPUs, and this can often vastly speed up operations.  NumPy does not build in that capability, but a number of projects allow this particular capability to be used outside of PyTorch, in varying ways (see [PyCUDA](https://documen.tician.de/pycuda/array.html), [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda/index.html), [CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org/), [MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/tutorials/basic/ndarray.html), and probably others).\n",
    "\n",
    "You *could* use PyTorch simply to work with array computation on GPUs, but what is more likely to bring you here is an equally essential capability that is not present in those other mentioned libraries (by design): Autograd.  By storing the gradients from every operation (where autograd is enabled for any component tensors), PyTorch provides reverse automatic differentiation.  That is to say, it gives you a directed acyclic graph whose leaves are the input tensors and roots are the output tensors.  We explain this more below."

    "## Creating a neural network with `torch.nn`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time when you want to create a neural network, you will use the higher-level capabilities in `torch.nn`.  Technically, the lower level basic tensor operations, or also autograd, do not require you to design neural networks *per se*.  Any sort of abstract data flow through a computational graph is equally possible.  But the abstraction of arranging clusters neurons in layers, and passing calculation from layer to layer, is a widely used and powerful one.\n",
    "\n",
    "One difference worth noting between PyTorch and other popular neural network frameworks, is that PyTorch is fully dynamic.  In TensorFlow, you are required compile a model and use it as-is.  In PyTorch, the layers in a network are simply tensors that you can poke at and modify dynamically within your custom code.  Put another way, PyTorch uses eager execution whereas some other libraries lazily define a computational graph in full before they can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is a relatively arcane technique to dynamically modify neural networks during training, and we will not cover that specifically in the beginning part of this course."

However, most of that difference is probably handled by a few  (dozen) rounds of the training.  More importantly, linear layers add a **bias** term automatically.  This is effectively the constant term in a linear function like `y = ax + b`; our simplest manual network lacks any such term which both makes it succeptible to overfitting and exploding loss."

    "Targetting CUDA GPUs is almost trivial under torch.  The only change we need to make is indicating where the tensors live, and the rest of the code works just the same.  Well, at first brush.  Using multiple GPUs or manual memory management of GPUs, or other lower level concerns, require additional work.  But the easy thing is easy, and is likely to speed up fitting considerably."
