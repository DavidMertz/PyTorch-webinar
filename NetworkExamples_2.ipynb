Of course, cloth is flexible, so these things interact somewhat.

In some ways, this is an advantage because we do not get discontinuities between a \"best guess\" and a \"second guess\" as we saw in the classification approach.  As a domain matter, the second guess should almost surely be \"a little bit smaller\" or a \"a little bit larger\" than the best guess.\n",

In the two dimensional sizing of the original garments, it is harder to say precisely what \"next largest\" or \"next smallest\" mean.  The visualization below simply makes a large number of predictions, and maps each point with an X-axis of the \"ground truth\" and a Y-axis of the prediction.  The predictions are continuous values, but those could easily be rounded to integers in the mapped range to make an actual garment size prediction.\n",

If the predictions were perfect, all the blue circles would lie on top of the red line.  The actual model is much worse than that.  It seems to do better than the classifier in some ways, but to a lesser degree also under-predicts the largest and smallest sizes, favoring middle sizes.  Moreover, the spread of predictions around the ground truth is not yet especially tight.\n",
