Then on the next pass, we re-select those points that are closest to the adjusted centroid (which likely differs from those in the prior pass).  After a while this process converges, and we stop when one iteration of centroids differs very little (less than a tolerance) to the last iteration.\n",

Concretely, that means that the partitioning is into convex hulls, which limits those clusters that can be recognized.  However, in high dimensional parametric space, almost all distributions are well divided in practice."
