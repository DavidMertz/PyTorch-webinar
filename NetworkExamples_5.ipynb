This example is taken very closely from the official [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html#example-an-lstm-for-part-of-speech-tagging) by Robert Guthrie.  Some minor changes are made to the code and new commentary is introduced.\n",

    "\n",
    "As was mentioned briefly, the class of network layers called Recurrent Neural Networks are able to remember state within a layer. In the case of an LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) layer, there are extra tensors defining the *hidden state* along with the direct state of the weights for that layer.  The hidden state is able to remember information from arbitrary earlier states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, an LSTM has three additional activation functions for the hidden state.  One activation function (also called a \"gate\") is the *input gate*, the next is the \"forget gate\", the last is the \"output gate.\"  Each of these gates is parameterized differently, and they each take the same inputs as would a fully-connected (linear) layer.  The key difference is that *some but not all* of the current hidden state will contribute to the input gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether a particular neuron is involved in feedback is based simply on the activation of its output gate.  But as well, depending on the parameters to the forget gate and the inputs, that hidden neuron may become free to be retrained on new information.  An illustration at the [A.I. Wiki](https://skymind.ai/wiki/lstm#long) provides a good overview.\n",
